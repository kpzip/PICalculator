"Fairly risky project that will depend a lot on the development environment. Not clear why 74HC138 will help read the buttons (could probably use SR for same purpose).         need to check what exists in terms of development environment    "This group chose the hardware as they "wanted a challenge". They are definitely one of the smarter groups in my section so I don't have much doubt that they will get it done. 

If you guys do think the hardware is more complex than neccesary, I'm sure they'd be okay with changing out the parts list."    "Are these people really experienced or did they find this project online? If the former, will all group members be able to contribute?

PIC16C74 likely does not have Arduino support. "ARM Cortex M4" is vague and any bare chip will likely only come in an SMD package. Both need a special programmer and special compiler setups. Would need to make a custom PCB or buy a dev board.

Why not just do everything in the M4 since it's vastly more powerful than the PIC?"    Looks like a very challenging project. I am not sure if all group members can contribute if they decide to go with this idea. I think one or two group members are pretty advanced. I feel like it would be hard to provide help to them since most mentors dont have experience with this microcontroller and it requires a different development environment.     Fairly sophisticated, were having issues with some operations outputting the wrong values"
